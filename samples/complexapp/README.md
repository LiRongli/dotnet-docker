# Building and testing multiple projects with Docker

It is easy to build and test multiple projects with Docker by following some basic patterns. Docker comes with some requirements and some useful mechanisms that can help you manage various container-based workflows.

The `complexapp` sample is intended to act as a [very simple](complexapp/Program.cs) "complex application". It is composed of multiple projects, including a test project. It is used to demonstrate various workflows.

Simpler workflows are provided at [.NET Core Docker samples](../README.md).

The instructions assume that you have cloned this repo, have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) installed, and have a command prompt open within the `samples/complexapp` directory within the repo.

## Building an image including multiple projects

The most common way to build images is using following pattern:

```console
docker build -t tag .
```

The most important aspect of that `docker` command is the `.` at the end. It represents the path to the build context, where Docker will look for assets that are referenced in the Dockerfile and for a `Dockerfile` (if not explicitly specified with the `-f` option). The build context is packaged up and then sent to the Docker daemon (the server), which performs the image build. It is required that all referenced assets are available within the build context, otherwise, they will not be available while the image is being built, which would produce an error.

In the case of an application with multiple project dependencies, it may be intuitive to place the Dockerfile beside the project file for the application project, and to assign the build context to that same location. This will not work because project dependencies will not exist within the build context.

Instead, in a multi-project solution, the best pattern is to place the Dockerfile at the same location you would place a solution file, which is typically one directory above the application project. At that location, you can use the pattern  demonstrated above, using `.` for the build context at the same location as the Dockerfile, and enabling all resources to be naturally located within that context.

This is the approach used with [complexapp](.). The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for the sample is at the same location as the `.sln` file, and all projects are available when that same location is used as the build context. There are other options, but this approach is the easiest.

You can build and run the complexapp using the following commands:

```console
docker build --pull -t complexapp .
docker run --rm complexapp
```

It will restore and build all required projects and produce an application image.

One or more of the projects in your solution might be test projects. It can be useful to include testing within same container-based workflow as the application. This is helpful for at least two reasons:

* Integrating testing into this workflow will ensure that tests run in the same environment as the application.
* Get test feedback to validate images before publishing to a registry and deploying to production.

There are two primary ways to test within the workflow of an application container image:

* Run `dotnet test` as a `RUN` step within the image build.
* Expose an opt-in `ENTRYPOINT` as part of a Dockerfile stage.

This is different than running tests within a [.NET Core SDK container](../run-tests-in-sdk-container.md), which establishes a generic environment (which also works well). The rest of this document is focused on running tests within the same container environment as the application.

## Running tests while building an image

It is possible to run tests as part of `docker build`. This approach can make sense if you want `docker build` to fail if your tests fail. It is not generally recommended, as will be described later in this section.

You can adopt this model by using the following Dockerfile pattern (the logging argument is optional):

```Dockerfile
RUN dotnet test --logger:trx
```

This approach is included in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), but is commented out (because it isn't recommended as a default workflow). You can uncomment the following lines if you want to try it.

```Dockerfile
# FROM test
# RUN dotnet test --logger:trx
```

You can then run tests using the normal `docker build` pattern, as follows:

```console
docker build --pull -t complexapp .
```

You will see that tests are run while building the image, as you can see in the following example (many build steps have been cut out to make the log easier to read).

```console
> docker build --pull -t complexapp .

```

After building the container image, it is still possible to get the logs from the intermediate container image in which the tests were run. The intermediate stage container image is listed as `6deeeacdaaf2` in the console output. Using that information, we can boot up the container image and copy the log files from it, using the following pattern:

```console
C:\git\dotnet-docker\samples\complexapp>docker images | findstr 6deeeacdaaf2
<none>                                        <none>                    6deeeacdaaf2        About a minute ago   910MB

```

There are two problems with this approach. It is cumbersome and if tests fail, it is not possible to copy the logs from the intermediate container layer, since that layer won't exist. This limitation, and the difficulty of copying files out of intermediate layers, demonstrates the weakness of this approach.

## Running tests as an opt-in stage

It is possible to run tests as the `ENTRYPOINT` to an opt-in build stage. The [Dockerfile](complexapp/Dockerfile) includes a `test` stage that demonstrates this pattern.

```Dockerfile
# test app
FROM build AS test
COPY tests/ /source/tests/
WORKDIR /source/tests
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "test", "--logger:trx"]
```

If you build this Dockerfile, you will get a working app in a container, and no tests will be run. The `ENTRYPOINT` that is added by the `test` stage will be overwritten by the final `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile. The `test` stage costs very little by being present and doesn't singificantly change the behavior of the build if you don't specifically target it.

The primary win of using an opt-in stage is that it enables testing using the same environment as the build as an opt-in scenario and allows volume mounting (which isn't possible with `docker build`) to collect test logs.

The following example demonstrates targeting the `test` stage with the `--target` argument, and with logging enabled:

```console
C:\git\dotnet-docker\samples\complexapp> docker build --pull --target test -t complexapp-test .
